#the basic command is: source -> condition -> target
#this is an action-flow
#if there is no condition, it can be simplified to: source -> target
#source, condition and target are actions. They can be written as: <actionName>(<parameters).
#
#
#
#
#currently the following source-actions are implemented:
#
#present((optional) unknown, (optional) everyTime, (optional) nonStrict)
#
#the standard behaviour is that this action fires at the first encountered presence, where the cause us the known to be the user
#and he is near izou
#pass everyTime to start the action-flow every time the user is encountered
#pass nonStrict to start the action-flow also if it is not guaranteed that the user is around
#pass unknown to start the action-flow also the when its not clear that the user caused the event
#
#after(<id>)
#
#this starts the action flow after an event with the specified id was fired.
#the id can be the full descriptor, or an descriptor written in common-events
#
#before(<id>)
#
#the same as after, the action-flow just gets triggered before the event gets processed
#
#
#
#
#condition actions:
#they can cancel the execution of the action-flow. Multiple conditions can be combined to an logical and by
#placing them inside Parentheses, separated by comma or to an logical or by placing them inside a vertical bar
#seperated by commas. Example: present() -> (action1(), action2) -> target
#
#after(<time>), before(<time>)
#these two conditions cancel the action-flow if the current time is not after/before the time specified in the argument
#(the format is ISO-8601, example: 10:15:30)
#
#present((optional) strict)
#cancels the action-flow if the user is guaranteed not to be around, if you pass strict it will only not cancel the
#action-flow if the user is around
#
#
#
#
#
#target actions:
#
#fire(<id>)
#
#fires an event with the type response and the specified id as an descriptor. they passed id may be directly the descriptor
#or an descriptor written in commonEvents
#
#play(<target>, (optional) <command>)
#
#starts music on the specified target, one may choose the track/playlist via the command parameter
#<target> := id=<id of the player>
#<command> := track=<name of the track> OR playlist=<name of the playlist>
